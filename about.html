        <h3><p><br>A hamburger is a sandwich made with a patty of ground beef that's been seasoned with salt and pepper, shaped into a round, and grilled or fried until it's cooked through. </br>
            <br>The patty is usually served on a soft bun along with toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.</br>
            <br>The hamburger's origin can be traced back to the city of Hamburg, Germany, where beef was minced, seasoned, and formed into patties. </br>
            <br>Immigrants brought this dish to the United States in the 19th century, and it became popular in fast-food chains like McDonald's and Burger King.</br></p></h3>
